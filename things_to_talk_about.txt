#Do the 1D demo and then the 5D demo
#then do the UI prototype

some things to talk about:
#- arc length computation is becoming the computational bottleneck
- fusing arc lengths over different regions is an open problem:
    - I have a dank method that doesn't work
    - Adam has a spicy heuristic that might work (idk yet)
- an "expected arc length"
- do we want arclength along line or shortest possible arclength?
